  abstract = {At the atomic scale, there has always been a trade-off between the ease of fabrication of structures and their thermal stability. Complex structures that are created effortlessly often disorder above cryogenic conditions. Conversely, systems with high thermal stability do not generally permit the same degree of complex manipulations. Here, we report scanning tunneling microscope (STM) techniques to substantially improve automated hydrogen lithography (HL) on silicon, and to transform state-of-the-art hydrogen repassivation into an efficient, accessible error correction/editing tool relative to existing chemical and mechanical methods. These techniques are readily adapted to many STMs, together enabling fabrication of error-free, room-temperature stable structures of unprecedented size. We created two rewriteable atomic memories (1.1 petabits per in2), storing the alphabet letter-by-letter in 8 bits and a piece of music in 192 bits. With HL no longer faced with this trade-off, practical silicon-based atomic-scale devices are poised to make rapid advances towards their full potential.},

  abstract = {Atomic silicon and reversible logic are domain fieldcoupled nanocomputing (FCN) techniques that have drawn significant attention for their lower power consumption, area, and design overhead. As atomic silicon and reversible logic reach dramatically reduced occupied area and power consumption, they can be a suitable alternative to CMOS technology. These technologies can significantly reduce the occupied area and energy consumption in all kinds of digital circuits, which are the two most challenging aspects of developing digital circuits. On the other hand, the Miller algorithm is a crucial synthesis for suggesting reversible circuits with extraordinary techniques in nanotechnology. It is an exceptionally effective and systematic method based on quantum rules for designing and proposing reversible circuits that can help suggest a reversible gate with low energy and a low occupied area. This study aims to construct novel nano-scale circuits with a focus on low-occupied area and minimal energy consumption as essential factors while designing digital circuits. In this paper, we propose a reversible gate with the wellknown Miller algorithm and atomic silicon technology. Then it is used to develop a reversible full adder, 4-bit ripple carry adder, and 4:2 compressor. Finally, the proposed structures are simulated using the SiQAD tool.},

  abstract = {Digital Image Processing (DIP) is the ability to manipulate digital photographs via algorithms for pattern detection, segmentation, enhancement, and noise reduction. In addition, the Internet of Things (IoT) acts as the eye and system for all DIP in various applications. It can possess a camera or another image sensor in order to capture real-time data from its environment. All vital data is processed by image processing in such a way that it recognizes the object, detects an anomaly, and automatically decides in real-time. In addition, in an IoT system, the median filter is the technique used for noise reduction by substituting the value of the pixel with the central value of the surrounding pixels. It provides speed and efficiency for quick analysis in all IoT systems. However, the images can get corrupted, especially in resource-constrained IoT devices with small cameras, because of random glitches. Moreover, using new quantum technology like atomic-scale silicon dangling bond (DB) logic circuits, which have advanced in fabrication and become a strong contender for field-coupled nano-computing, can solve previous problems in IoT systems. In this paper, we propose a unique quantum CSM based on two new proposed Mux and De-mux. The proposed CSM can be used for computational circuits like median filter circuits (MFC) in a wide range of digital circuits, specifically IoT devices. The proposed design is verified and validated using the powerful SiQAD tool. When comparing CSM to the newest designs, the suggested quantum circuit uses 85\% less energy and takes up 61\% less area.},

  abstract = {We present a novel application of evolutionary algorithms to automate the creation of powerful foundation models. While model merging has emerged as a promising approach for LLM development due to its cost-effectiveness, it currently relies on human intuition and domain knowledge, limiting its potential. Here, we propose an evolutionary approach that overcomes this limitation by automatically discovering effective combinations of diverse open-source models, harnessing their collective intelligence without requiring extensive additional training data or compute. Our approach operates in both parameter space and data flow space, allowing for optimization beyond just the weights of the individual models. This approach even facilitates cross-domain merging, generating models like a Japanese LLM with Math reasoning capabilities. Surprisingly, our Japanese Math LLM achieved state-of-the-art performance on a variety of established Japanese LLM benchmarks, even surpassing models with significantly more parameters, despite not being explicitly trained for such tasks. Furthermore, a culturally-aware Japanese VLM generated through our approach demonstrates its effectiveness in describing Japanese culture-specific content, outperforming previous Japanese VLMs. This work not only contributes new state-of-the-art models back to the open-source community, but also introduces a new paradigm for automated model composition, paving the way for exploring alternative, efficient approaches to foundation model development.},

Optical or optoelectronic MAC operations on today's SOI-based silicon photonic integrated circuit platforms can be realized at a speed of tens of GHz, leading to much lower latency and higher throughput. In this Perspective, we study the energy efficiency of integrated silicon photonic MAC circuits based on Mach--Zehnder modulators and microring resonators.

A single spin-polarized dangling bond center (DBC) near the DBW may strongly affect transport as characterized by anti-resonances or dips in the transmission spectra. Such spin-dependent gating can be effective up to a distance of 1.5 nanometer between the DBW and the DBC. At the energies where anti-resonances occur, the scattering states of the system are found to be ``attracted'' to the DBC -- rather than moving forward to the existing electrode. The variety of gating effects can be well organized by a physical picture,               i.e.               a strong hybridization or interaction between the spin-polarized DBW and DBC occurs with the same spin polarization (at DBW and DBC) and at similar energy.

It encodes information in the charge distribution of molecules and propagates it through electrostatic intermolecular interaction. Despite its potential, the molFCN technology suffers the absence of a functional design and simulation methodology. This paper provides a complete explanation of the characterization and modeling of molecules, from the molecular ab initio analysis to the design of molecular circuits and systems. Considering the diallyl-butane, we show how to use the ORCA package to derive, with DFT, the molecule geometry and charge distribution by correctly setting DFT functionals and basis sets. We study the molecule polarization when subjected to electric fields and enable the investigation of the interaction by exploiting the SCERPA tool. We set up the SCERPA simulation engine to simulate molecular circuits such as diallyl-butane wires. Finally, we show how to use literature results to model more complex molecules. We implement the bis-ferrocene cation in SCERPA and use it to create complex clocked logical devices. We simulate, as a means of explanation, a 0.0004 \textmu m2 NAND gate.},

We evaluate DWNs in three edge computing contexts: (1) an FPGA-based hardware accelerator, where they demonstrate superior latency, throughput, energy efficiency, and model area compared to state-of-the-art solutions, (2) a low-power microcontroller, where they achieve preferable accuracy to XGBoost while subject to stringent memory constraints, and (3) ultra-low-cost chips, where they consistently outperform small models in both accuracy and projected hardware area. DWNs also compare favorably against leading approaches for tabular datasets, with higher average rank.

METHODS               Veterans with lung cancer were randomly assigned to usual care (control group) or usual care with proactive symptom assessment in which a peer volunteer made weekly phone calls to assess patient symptoms under nurse practitioner supervision. The primary outcome was oncologist documentation of symptoms in the electronic health record at all clinical visits within 6 months after enrollment. Secondary outcomes included patient satisfaction with decision, patient activation, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and symptom burden, measured at baseline, and 3, 6, and 9 months after enrollment, and acute care use within 9 months after enrollment.                                         RESULTS               Among 60 Veterans randomly assigned, median (range) age was 70.2 (50-86) years; 57 (95.0\%) were male. More intervention participants had oncologist documentation of symptoms than control group participants (24 [77.4\%] v seven [24.1\%], respectively; odds ratio, 16.46 [95\% CI, 4.58 to 59.16]). Intervention group participants had greater improvements over time in HRQOL (expected mean difference, 25.3 [95\% CI, 15.00 to 35.70]) and patient activation (expected mean difference, 13.6 [95\% CI, 3.79 to 23.39]), lower symptom burden (expected mean difference, --6.39 [95\% CI, --15.21 to --2.46]), lower rates of emergency room visits (incidence rate ratio, 0.48 [95\% CI, 0.30 to 0.75]), and hospitalizations (incidence rate ratio, 0.47 [95\% CI, 0.28 to 0.77]) than control group participants.

  abstract = {Landauer's principle, often regarded as the basic principle of the thermodynamics of information processing, holds that any logically irreversible manipulation of information, such as the erasure of a bit or the merging of two computation paths, must be accompanied by a corresponding entropy increase in non-information-bearing degrees of freedom of the information-processing apparatus or its environment. Conversely, it is generally accepted that any logically reversible transformation of information can in principle be accomplished by an appropriate physical mechanism operating in a thermodynamically reversible fashion. These notions have sometimes been criticized either as being false, or as being trivial and obvious, and therefore unhelpful for purposes such as explaining why Maxwell's Demon cannot violate the second law of thermodynamics. Here I attempt to refute some of the arguments against Landauer's principle, while arguing that although in a sense it is indeed a straightforward consequence or restatement of the Second Law, it still has considerable pedagogic and explanatory power, especially in the context of other influential ideas in nineteenth and twentieth century physics. Similar arguments have been given by Jeffrey Bub (2002).},

  abstract = {In the molecular quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) paradigm clocking wires are used to produce an electric field which is perpendicular to the device plane of surface-bound molecules and is sinusoidally modulated in space and time. This clocking field guides the data flow through the molecular QCA array. Power is dissipated in clocking wires due to the non-zero resistance of the conductors. We analyze quantitatively the amount of power dissipated in the clocking wires and find that in the relevant parameter range it is fairly small. Dissipation in the molecular devices themselves will likely dominate the energy budget.}

Here we discuss the state of this emerging technology, including recent developments in photonic building blocks and circuit architectures, as well as electronic control and programming strategies. We cover possible applications in linear matrix operations, quantum information processing and microwave photonics, and examine how these generic chips can accelerate the development of future photonic circuits by providing a higher-level platform for prototyping novel optical functionalities without the need for custom chip fabrication.},

In this work, we investigate quantum transport properties of such dangling bond wires (DBWs) by a state-of-the-art first-principles technique. It is found that the conductance of the DBW can be gated by electrostatic potential and orbital overlap due to only a single DB center (DBC) within a distance of {$\sim$}16 \AA{} from the DBW. The gating effect is more pronounced for two DBCs and especially, when these two DB ``gates'' are within {$\sim$}3.9 \AA{} from each other. These effective length scales are in excellent agreement with those measured in scanning tunnelling microscope experiments. By analyzing transmission spectrum and density of states of DBC-DBW systems, with or without subsurface doping, for different length of the DBW, distance between DBCs and the DBW, and distance between DB gates, we conclude that charge transport in a DBW can be regulated to have both an on-state and an off-state using only one or two DBs.},

We confirm that the crowdsourced questions are sufficiently diverse and discriminating and that the crowdsourced human votes are in good agreement with those of expert raters. These analyses collectively establish a robust foundation for the credibility of Chatbot Arena.

  abstract = {Novel advancements in silicon dangling bond (SiDB) fabrication has led to logical circuitry at the atomic scale, with crucial building blocks including binary wires and logic gates experimentally demonstrated on the SiDB platform. However, complex SiDB circuitry will require clocking control for signal propagation and timing. This work proposes the use of control and clocking electrodes commonly presented in quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) implementations for the SiDB platform and introduces PoisSolver, a simulation engine used to obtain clocking potentials in a SiDB system with complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) metal layers. PoisSolver is built into the SiQAD computer aided design (CAD) tool, aiding circuit design by visualising electric potentials and providing potential solutions to other built-in SiQAD simulation engines. Utilising PoisSolver's output and the electrode design in SiQAD, geometry agnostic methods are employed to estimate power characteristics for QCA's columnar, wave, and USE clocking schemes. Parasitic power densities of these clocking schemes are estimated to be on the order of 10-100{$\mu$}W cm{$^{-2}$} at 1GHz and 77K. The potentially low power dissipation of SiDBs is extremely attractive for low power applications. As a result, a novel CMOS-to-SiDB flash analog-to-digital converter (ADC) proof-of-concept is designed using PoisSolver and SiQAD as a case study. A 2-bit implementation of the flash ADC is estimated to perform on par with thermal-noise limited CMOS ADCs in the worst case, and approximately four orders of magnitude better in the best case, depending on the elasticity of SiDB relaxations.},

This neutral mixed-valence FeII/FeIII complex overcomes the proximal electronic bias imposed by external counterions, a practical limitation in the use of molecular switches.

This electronic framework therefore provides the possibility of an all-neutral null state, a key requirement for the implementation of quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) molecular computing.

This approach, has recently been adopted for superconducting qubits, but has received little attention for spin qubits in semiconductors. Here, we employ models for both the device and the quantum mechanical states in the valence band to theoretically investigate the properties of hole spin qubits in laterally gated quantum dots in group-IV materials, which have received significant recent attention. We find that device design impacts qubit properties in unexpected ways. First, the presence of optimal operation points where coherence times are long and qubits can be rapidly manipulated results not only from gate-voltage-induced changes to the Rashba coefficient, but also from gate-voltage-induced changes to quantum dot radius in real devices, which impacts g-factor even when inversion symmetry is preserved (Rashba coupling is zero). Second, the qubit electric manipulation is substantially higher in the realistic anharmonic potential, by an order of magnitude in the device design we consider, compared with a harmonic potential assumption, because the transverse electric dipole of the qubit depends on electrically mediated couplings to many excited states. Finally, we show that the rapid electric drive, compatible with long coherence times, can be achieved in the single-hole regime, with and without strain. These results establish the need for realistic description of both the device and the quantum mechanical states to support the design of spin qubit devices, identify new ways to control hole qubit properties.},

While using the latter two RNG's leads to reasonably similar physical features, the LCG produces significant different results. For the pure fluids, a noticeable expansion occurs. Using the original LCG on butane yields, a molecular volume of 171.4 \AA 3 per molecule compared to about 163.6--163.9 \AA 3 for the other two generators, a deviation of about 5\%. For methanol, the LCG produces an average volume of 86.3 \AA 3 per molecule, which is about 24\% higher than the 68.8--70.2 \AA 3 obtained with the RNG's in BOSS and the generator by Matsumoto and Nishimura. In case of the hydrated tridecaalanine peptide, the volume and energy tend to be noticeably greater with the LCG than with the BOSS (modified LCG) RNG's. For the simulated hydrated extended conformation of tridecaalanine, the difference in volume reached about 87\%. The uniformity and periodicity of the generators do not seem to play the crucial role in these phenomena. We conclude that, it is important to test a RNG's by modeling a system such as the pure liquid methanol with a well-established force field before routinely employing it in Monte Carlo simulations. \copyright{} 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {The combination of scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and non-contact atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM) allows enhanced extraction and correlation of properties not readily available via a single imaging mode. We demonstrate this through the characterization and classification of several commonly found defects of the hydrogen-terminated silicon (100)-2 \texttimes{} 1 surface (H--Si(100)-2 \texttimes{} 1) by using six unique imaging modes. The H--Si surface was chosen as it provides a promising platform for the development of atom scale devices, with recent work showing their creation through precise desorption or placement of surface hydrogen atoms. While samples with relatively large areas of the H--Si surface are routinely created using an in situ methodology, surface defects are inevitably formed reducing the area available for patterning. By probing the surface using the different interactivity afforded by either hydrogen- or silicon-terminated tips, we are able to extract new insights regarding the atomic and electronic structure of these defects. This allows for the confirmation of literature assignments of several commonly found defects, as well as proposed classifications of previously unreported and unassigned defects. By combining insights from multiple imaging modes, better understanding of their successes and shortcomings in identifying defect structures and origins is achieved. With this, we take the first steps toward enabling the creation of superior H--Si surfaces through an improved understanding of surface defects, ultimately leading to more consistent and reliable fabrication of atom scale devices.},

  abstract = {The development of the modern transistor has sparked a technological revolution which has flourished for the past 70 years. Advancements in transistor design and fabrication have allowed for their continued shrinking in size and increase in operation speed. With the continued reduction in size of transistors to {$\sim$} 10,000s of atoms, their expected increase in operation speed has reached a roadblock. In order to see any continued increase in operation speed, novel device designs made from few to single atoms or molecules must be explored. One such candidate is Binary Atomic Silicon Logic (BASiL) which relies on selectively patterning dangling bonds (DBs) on an otherwise hydrogen terminated silicon (H-Si) surface. These DBs act as quantum dots allowing for the controlled localization of charge within DB structures. While proof of concept studies have shown the utility in the application of BASiL devices to supplement and replace the transistor, further studies are needed to realize its full potential.},

It enables the creation of circuitry using single atoms as elementary components. Since contemporary computational technologies approach their physical limits, SiDBs have attracted significant interest from both academia and industry. SiDBs allow for gate implementation of Boolean functions to realize arbitrary circuit logic. Hence, improvements at the gate level propagate through to the circuit level. Although fabrication capabilities are advancing rapidly and initial design automation methodologies have been proposed, the current design of SiDB gates is primarily based on manual labor. This paper presents an approach capable of designing SiDB gates using the minimum number of SiDBs possible for a given Boolean function, thus minimizing gate cost and providing an optimal basis for SiDB circuits. This methodology simplifies SiDB circuit designs and their corresponding manufacturing processes significantly, thereby accelerating the progress of this promising nanotechnology.},

  abstract = {Silicon Dangling Bonds (SiDBs) have emerged as a promising post-CMOS technology for achieving ultra-low power dissipation, establishing themselves as a highly anticipated and environmentally friendly competitor in the realm beyond conventional CMOS. To support the SiDB logic framework, design automation approaches have rapidly evolved. However, at the atomic scale of SiDBs, material imperfections pose a significant roadblock in scaling these devices. Consequently, established design automation flows, which are defect-agnostic, are inadequate and have not kept pace with the latest experimental findings and advances in fabrication capabilities. A first attempt was recently proposed that extends established defect-agnostic physical design methods by rudimentary defect-aware capabilities. While promising at first glance, in this work, we show that this first attempt yields unsatisfactory results. Subsequently, we present a novel approach that automatically designs a tailored SiDB gate on-the-fly whenever an SiDB gate encounters atomic defects in its vicinity, thereby incorporating these atomic defects into its layout as an integral part. Our experimental evaluations confirm that the proposed approach is capable of designing SiDB circuits of significant complexity and size, even in the presence of atomic defects for the first time. Therefore, this work contributes to advancing this promising post-CMOS technology.},

Starting with an analysis of the one available on chip source of randomness - the PLL synthesized low jitter clock signal, a new simple and reliable method of true randomness extraction is proposed. Basic assumptions about statistical properties of jitter signal are confirmed by testing of mean value of the TRNG output signal. The quality of generated true random numbers is confirmed by passing standard NIST statistical tests. The described TRNG is tailored for embedded System-On-a-Programmable- Chip (SOPC) cryptographic applications and can provide a good quality true random bit-stream with throughput of several tens of kilobits per second. The possibility of including the proposed TRNG into a SOPC design significantly increases the system security of embedded cryptographic hardware.},

We study three of these methods, Contrastive Divergence (CD) and its refined variants Persistent CD (PCD) and Fast PCD (FPCD). As the approximations are biased, the maximum of the log-likelihood is not necessarily obtained. Recently, it has been shown that CD, PCD, and FPCD can even lead to a steady decrease of the log-likelihood during learning. Taking artificial data sets from the literature we study these divergence effects in more detail. Our results indicate that the log-likelihood seems to diverge especially if the target distribution is difficult to learn for the RBM. The decrease of the likelihood can not be detected by an increase of the reconstruction error, which has been proposed as a stopping criterion for CD learning. Weight-decay with a carefully chosen weight-decay-parameter can prevent divergence.},

This tutorial introduces RBMs from the viewpoint of Markov random fields, starting with the required concepts of undirected graphical models. Different learning algorithms for RBMs, including contrastive divergence learning and parallel tempering, are discussed. As sampling from RBMs, and therefore also most of their learning algorithms, are based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, an introduction to Markov chains and MCMC techniques is provided. Experiments demonstrate relevant aspects of RBM training.},

It has been rapidly developing into a powerful and versatile tool for tissue engineering. Recent advances in bioprinting modalities and biofabrication strategies as well as new materials and chemistries have led to improved mimicry and development of physiologically relevant tissue architectures constituted with multiple cell types and heterogeneous spatial material properties. Machine learning (ML) has been applied to accelerate these processes. It is a new paradigm for bioprinting. In this review, we explore current trends in bioink formulation and how ML has been used to accelerate optimization and enable real-time error detection as well as to reduce the iterative steps necessary for bioink formulation. We examined how rheometric properties, including shear storage, loss moduli, viscosity, shear-thinning property of biomaterials affect the printability of a bioink. Furthermore, we scrutinized the interplays between yield shear stress and the printability of a bioink. Moreover, we systematically surveyed the application of ML in precision in situ surgical site bioprinting, closed-loop AI printing, and post-printing optimization.},

  abstract = {The ability to control matter at the atomic scale and build devices with atomic precision is central to nanotechnology. The scanning tunnelling microscope1 can manipulate individual atoms2 and molecules on surfaces, but the manipulation of silicon to make atomic-scale logic circuits has been hampered by the covalent nature of its bonds. Resist-based strategies have allowed the formation of atomic-scale structures on silicon surfaces3, but the fabrication of working devices---such as transistors with extremely short gate lengths4, spin-based quantum computers5,6,7,8 and solitary dopant optoelectronic devices9---requires the ability to position individual atoms in a silicon crystal with atomic precision. Here, we use a combination of scanning tunnelling microscopy and hydrogen-resist lithography to demonstrate a single-atom transistor in which an individual phosphorus dopant atom has been deterministically placed within an epitaxial silicon device architecture with a spatial accuracy of one lattice site. The transistor operates at liquid helium temperatures, and millikelvin electron transport measurements confirm the presence of discrete quantum levels in the energy spectrum of the phosphorus atom. We find a charging energy that is close to the bulk value, previously only observed by optical spectroscopy10.},

The quest for true randomness in these applications has engendered a large variety of different proposals for producing random numbers based on the foundational unpredictability of quantum mechanics4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. However, most approaches do not consider that a potential adversary could have knowledge about the generated numbers, so the numbers are not verifiably random and unique12,13,14,15. Here we present a simple experimental setup based on homodyne measurements that uses the purity of a continuous-variable quantum vacuum state to generate unique random numbers. We use the intrinsic randomness in measuring the quadratures of a mode in the lowest energy vacuum state, which cannot be correlated to any other state. The simplicity of our source, combined with its verifiably unique randomness, are important attributes for achieving high-reliability, high-speed and low-cost quantum random number generators.},

  title = {Weight-Sparse Transformers Have Interpretable Circuits},
  author = {Gao, Leo and others},
  abstract = {Finding human-understandable circuits in language models is a central goal of the field of mechanistic interpretability. We train models to have more understandable circuits by constraining most of their weights to be zeros, so that each neuron only has a few connections. To recover fine-grained circuits underlying each of several hand-crafted tasks, we prune the models to isolate the part responsible for the task. These circuits often contain neurons and residual channels that correspond to natural concepts, with a small number of straightforwardly interpretable connections between them. We study how these models scale and find that making weights sparser trades off capability for interpretability, and scaling model size improves the capability-interpretability frontier. However, scaling sparse models beyond tens of millions of nonzero parameters while preserving interpretability remains a challenge. In addition to training weight-sparse models de novo, we show preliminary results suggesting our method can also be adapted to explain existing dense models. Our work produces circuits that achieve an unprecedented level of human understandability and validates them with considerable rigor.},

Two types of systems were tested: conformational sampling of a small molecule in aqueous solution and liquid methanol under constant temperature and pressure. The results show that poor quality pseudorandom number generators produce results that deviate significantly from those obtained with the quantum-based random number generator, particularly in the case of the small molecule in aqueous solution setup.

  abstract = {With the predicted end of CMOS scaling process, researchers started to study several alternative technologies. Among them NanoMagnet Logic (NML) offers advantages complementary to MOS transistors especially for its magnetic nature. Its intrinsic memory capability makes it suitable for zero stand-by power and logic-in-memory applications. NML requires a clock system that, if based on a magnetic field, highly increases the circuit dynamic power consumption. We have recently proposed a solution based on the magnetoelastic effect (ME-NML) [1] and on currently available fabrication processes, which drastically reduces dynamic power consumption. However, many questions still remain unanswered. Which kind of applications are best suited for this technology? How can we effectively design, analyze, and compare ME-NML circuits? Does it really offer advantages over state-of-the-art CMOS transistors? In this paper, we provide answers to all these questions and the results prove that this technology offers indeed extremely good performance. We have designed a Galois field multiplier with a systolic array structure to reduce interconnection overhead. We developed a new RTL model that allows us to easily describe and simulate circuits of any complexity, evaluating at the same time the performance and keeping into account technology constraints. We approach for the first time in the NML scenario the design of ME-NML circuits adopting the standard-cell method used in standard technologies and fulfill the design down to the physical level. The same circuit is designed also with NML technology based on magnetic fields and with a 28 nm low power CMOS bulk technology for comparison. The CMOS circuit is obtained through physical place\&route with a commercial tool, providing, therefore, the most accurate comparison ever presented in literature. Power analysis shows that ME-NML circuits have a considerable advantage over both NML and state-of-the-art CMOS bulk technology. As a further by-product results clearly highlight which kind of architectures can better exploit the true potential of NML technology.},

  abstract = {Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5\texttimes{} higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.},

  abstract = {Despite an increasing adoption of high-level synthesis (HLS) for its design productivity advantages, there remains a significant gap in the achievable clock frequency between an HLS-generated design and a handcrafted RTL one. A key factor that limits the timing quality of the HLS outputs is the difficulty in accurately estimating the interconnect delay at the HLS level. Unfortunately, this problem becomes even worse when large HLS designs are implemented on the latest multi-die FPGAs, where die-crossing interconnects incur a high delay penalty.To tackle this challenge, we propose AutoBridge, an automated framework that couples a coarse-grained floorplanning step with pipelining during HLS compilation. First, our approach provides HLS with a view on the global physical layout of the design, allowing HLS to more easily identify and pipeline the long wires, especially those crossing the die boundaries. Second, by exploiting the flexibility of HLS pipelining, the floorplanner is able to distribute the design logic across multiple dies on the FPGA device without degrading clock frequency. This prevents the placer from aggressively packing the logic on a single die which often results in local routing congestion that eventually degrades timing. Since pipelining may introduce additional latency, we further present analysis and algorithms to ensure the added latency will not compromise the overall throughput.AutoBridge can be integrated into the existing CAD toolflow for Xilinx FPGAs. In our experiments with a total of 43 design configurations, we improve the average frequency from 147 MHz to 297 MHz (a 102\% improvement) with no loss of throughput and a negligible change in resource utilization. Notably, in 16 experiments we make the originally unroutable designs achieve 274 MHz on average. The tool is available at https://github.com/Licheng-Guo/AutoBridge.},

Hardware correctness is becoming increasingly important due to the growing use of custom accelerators using FPGAs to speed up applications on servers. Furthermore, the increasing complexity of hardware also leads to ever more reliance on automation, meaning that the correctness of synthesis tools is vital for the reliability of the hardware. This paper aims to improve the quality of FPGA synthesis tools by introducing a method to test them automatically using randomly generated, correct Verilog, and checking that the synthesised netlist is always equivalent to the original design. The main contributions of this work are twofold: firstly a method for generating random behavioural Verilog free of undefined values, and secondly a Verilog test case reducer used to locate the cause of the bug that was found. These are implemented in a tool called Verismith. This paper also provides a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the bugs found in Yosys, Vivado, XST and Quartus Prime. Every synthesis tool except Quartus Prime was found to introduce discrepancies between the netlist and the design. In addition to that, Vivado and a development version of Yosys were found to crash when given valid input. Using Verismith, eleven bugs were reported to tool vendors, of which six have already been fixed.},

In practice, to avoid this problem, researchers have used domain specific a-priori knowledge to give meaning to the hidden or state variables representing past context. In this paper, we propose to use a more general type of a-priori knowledge, namely that the temporal dependencies are structured hierarchically. This implies that long-term dependencies are represented by variables with a long time scale. This principle is applied to a recurrent network which includes delays and multiple time scales. Experiments confirm the advantages of such structures. A similar approach is proposed for HMMs and IOHMMs.}

One promising contestant in this domain is Field-coupled Nanocomputing (FCN), which conducts computations based on the repulsion of physical fields at the nanoscale. However, to realize a dedicated functionality in this technology design methods are needed that create corresponding FCN layouts. While several methods for FCN layout generation have been proposed in the past, the underlying complexity requires them to resort to heuristic approaches---leading to results of sub-par quality and offering room for improvement. In conventional CMOS design, post-layout optimization methods are available to exploit this potential for further improvement. Unfortunately, no such methods exists yet for FCN. In this work, we are addressing this gap and introduce the first post-layout optimization approach for FCN. Experimental evaluations show the benefits of the approach: Applied to layouts generated by two complementary state-of-the-art methods, the proposed post-layout optimization allows for a further area reduction of 50.79 \% and 20.00 \% on average, respectively---confirming the potential of post-layout optimization for FCN.},

  abstract = {With the ever-increasing demands of computing, post-CMOS technologies are sought after. Field-coupled Nanocomputing (FCN), which relies on physical field repulsion, is a class of technologies for energy-efficient computing. While the physical design for Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) has been researched for more than 20 years, the methodologies for its promising successor, namely Silicon Dangling Bonds (SiDBs), have yet to catch up. To prevent reinventing the wheel and utilizing the 20 years of development in QCA, this paper presents a methodology to create SiDB designs based on existing QCA design approaches by a 45{$^\circ$} rotation, implemented as a remapping algorithm. The presented approach enables the direct translation of QCA layouts to SiDB ones with minimal overhead and allows to tap knowledge from decades of research.},

  abstract = {Field-coupled Nanocomputing (FCN) has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional CMOS technology, driven by recent advancements in atomic-scale logic gate fabrication and simulation. However, the efficient placement and routing of logic functions remain significant challenges, with existing algorithms lacking scalability or quality. In this paper, we present a novel method aimed at addressing these challenges by focusing on the generation of layouts with outstanding quality in a fraction of the time compared to existing approaches. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that our method significantly reduces area overhead, outperforming two state-of-the-art heuristics by more than 70 \% and 24 \%, respectively, while achieving these results at a remarkable 460 times faster pace compared to the latter. Furthermore, we contribute to open science by releasing our algorithm as an open-source implementation, fostering collaboration and further advancements in the field of FCN.},

Hence, it is imperative to reconsider physical design strategies tailored for FCN to effectively address this distinctive characteristic. This paper unveils a recent breakthrough in minimizing the number of wire segments by an average of 20.13 \%, which, due to the high cost associated with wires, also leads to an average decrease of 34.10 \% in overall area and 19.84 \% in critical path length. Furthermore, unlike existing post-layout optimization algorithms, the proposed method maintains scalability even for layouts encompassing millions of tiles.},

On the other hand, this natural stochasticity can be valuable for hardware security applications. Here we propose and demonstrate a novel true random number generator utilizing the stochastic delay time of threshold switching in a Ag:SiO2 diffusive memristor, which exhibits evident advantages in scalability, circuit complexity, and power consumption. The random bits generated by the diffusive memristor true random number generator pass all 15 NIST randomness tests without any post-processing, a first for memristive-switching true random number generators. Based on nanoparticle dynamic simulation and analytical estimates, we attribute the stochasticity in delay time to the probabilistic process by which Ag particles detach from a Ag reservoir. This work paves the way for memristors in hardware security applications for the era of the Internet of Things.}

Part quality and reliability are essential to maintaining the biocompatibility and structural integrity needed for engineered tissue constructs. As a result, it is critical to detect for any anomalies that may occur in the 3Dbioprinting process that can cause a mismatch between the desired designs and printed shapes. However, challenges exist in detecting the imperfections within oftentimes transparent bioprinted and complex printing features accurately and efficiently. In this study, an anomaly detection system based on layer-by-layer sensor images and machine learning algorithms is developed to distinguish and classify imperfections for transparent hydrogel-based bioprinted materials. High anomaly detection accuracy is obtained by utilizing convolutional neural network methods as well as advanced image processing and augmentation techniques on extracted small image patches. Along with the prediction of various anomalies, the category of infill pattern and location information on the image patches can be accurately determined. It is envisioned that using our detection system to categorize and localize printing anomalies, real-time autonomous correction of process parameters can be realized to achieve high-quality tissue constructs in 3D-bioprinting processes.},

Recent progress in the construction of atomic-size interconnects (Weber et al 2012 Science 335 64) shows the possibility to achieve atomic-size circuits via atomic-size wires using silicon surfaces. Hence, electron transport through quasi-1D Si-based structures is a compelling reality. Prior to these achievements, wires formed by controlled desorption of passivating H atoms off the monohydride Si(100) surface have been shown to be subject to 1D correlations and instabilities (Hitosugi et al 1999 Phys. Rev. Lett. 82 4034). The present calculations are based on density functional theory and evaluate the electron transmission though the minimum-energy 1D structures that can be formed when creating dangling-bonds on Si(100)-(2 \texttimes{} 1)-H. The purpose of this study is twofold: (i) to assess the transport properties of these atomic-size wires in the presence of 1D instabilities; (ii) to provide a fingerprint for experimental identification of the instability through the transport characteristics of the wires. To these aims, we evaluate the electron transport through the wires in the absence of instabilities, in the presence of distortions (Jahn--Teller instabilities) and in the presence of magnetic instabilities (ferro- and antiferro-ordering). We find that instabilities substantially reduce the transport capabilities of dangling-bond wires leading to transmissions that vary so differently with electron energy that an unambiguous identification of the wire type should be accessible in transport experiments.},

  abstract = {Surface-state engineering strategies for atomic-size interconnects on H-passivated Si(100) surfaces are explored. The wellknown simple interconnect formed by removing H-atoms from one of the Si atoms per dimer of a dimer row along the Si(100) surface is poorly conducting. This is because one-dimensional-like instabilities open electronic gaps. Here, we explore two strategies to reduce the instabilities: spacing the dangling bonds with H atoms and changing the geometry by increasing the lateral size of the wires. The resulting wires are evaluated using density functional theory. Surprisingly, zigzag dangling-bond wires attain atomically confined conduction properties comparable with the conduction of free-standing metallic monatomic wires. These results hint at band-engineering strategies for the development of electronically driven nanocircuits.},

Until recently, designers using FPGAs had less than optimal choices for a source of truly random bits. In this paper we extend a technique that uses on-chip jitter and PLLs to a much larger class of FPGAs that do not contain PLLs. Our design uses only the Configurable Logic Blocks (CLBs) common to all FPGAs, and has a self-testing capability. Using the intrinsic jitter contained in digital circuits, we produce random bits at speeds of up to 0.5 Mbits/second with good statistical characteristics. We discuss the engineering challenges of extracting random bits from digital circuits, and we report the results of running standard statistical tests (NIST) on the output generated by our system.},

However, RBMs are usually used as feature extractors for another learning algorithm or to provide a good initialization for deep feed-forward neural network classifiers, and are not considered as a standalone solution to classification problems. In this paper, we argue that RBMs provide a self-contained framework for deriving competitive non-linear classifiers. We present an evaluation of different learning algorithms for RBMs which aim at introducing a discriminative component to RBM training and improve their performance as classifiers. This approach is simple in that RBMs are used directly to build a classifier, rather than as a stepping stone. Finally, we demonstrate how discriminative RBMs can also be successfully employed in a semi-supervised setting.},

The system combines local image sampling, a self-organizing map (SOM) neural network, and a convolutional neural network. The SOM provides a quantization of the image samples into a topological space where inputs that are nearby in the original space are also nearby in the output space, thereby providing dimensionality reduction and invariance to minor changes in the image sample, and the convolutional neural network provides partial invariance to translation, rotation, scale, and deformation. The convolutional network extracts successively larger features in a hierarchical set of layers. We present results using the Karhunen-Loeve transform in place of the SOM, and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) in place of the convolutional network for comparison. We use a database of 400 images of 40 individuals which contains quite a high degree of variability in expression, pose, and facial details. We analyze the computational complexity and discuss how new classes could be added to the trained recognizer.},

Computing in such a paradigm is edge driven. Input, output, and power are delivered at the edge of the CA array only; no direct flow of information or energy to internal cells is required. Computing in this paradigm is also computing with the ground state. The architecture is so designed that the ground-state configuration of the array, subject to boundary conditions determined by the input, yields the computational result. The authors propose a specific realization of these ideas using two-electron cells composed of quantum dots. The charge density in the cell is very highly polarized (aligned) along one of the two cell axes, suggestive of a two-state CA. The polarization of one cell induces a polarization in a neighboring cell through the Coulomb interaction in a very non-linear fashion. Quantum cellular automata can perform useful computing. The authors show that AND gates, OR gates, and inverters can be constructed and interconnected.},

  abstract = {Molecular Field-Coupled Nanocomputing (molFCN) emerges as a promising technology for addressing the challenges posed by CMOS scaling. In molFCN, the charge distribution of molecules encodes binary information. Properly arranging molecules in specific layouts produces wires and logic gates in which the information propagates by electrostatic intermolecular interaction with nearby molecules. Prior research offered promising insights into the static properties of information propagation within molFCN circuits, providing a theoretical description of the mechanism. However, the promising frequencyswitching capabilities of molFCN still need to be validated. The frequency study of molecules is essential for ensuring the overall reliability of future molFCN devices. Consequently, this paper introduces a new methodology combining Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Real-Time Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (RT-TDDFT) simulations for determining the maximum switching frequency of molFCN candidate molecules. We validate the methodology using the oxidized 1,4-diallyl butane molecule. Our findings demonstrate the possibility of achieving hundreds of gigahertz-level switching frequencies for the 1,4-diallyl butane. Moreover, the results report the nonlinear molecule behavior when subjected to electric field excitations above its charge-switching frequency limits. Overall, this work presents advances in addressing the time-domain modeling of molFCN candidate molecules, opening pathways for improving existing models for molFCN circuits.},

We design a self-guided upsample module to tackle the interpolation blur problem caused by bilinear upsampling between pyramid levels. Moreover, we propose a pyramid distillation loss to add supervision for intermediate levels via distilling the finest flow as pseudo labels. By integrating these two components together, our method achieves the best performance for unsupervised optical flow learning on multiple leading benchmarks, including MPI-SIntel, KITTI 2012 and KITTI 2015.

The automated designer is capable of navigating the complex, hyperdimensional design spaces of arbitrarily sized design areas and truth tables by employing a tabula rasa double-deep Q-learning reinforcement learning algorithm. Robust policy convergence is demonstrated for a wide range of two-input, one-output logic circuits and a two-input, two-output half-adder, designed with an order of magnitude fewer SiDBs in several orders of magnitude less time than the only other half-adder demonstrated in the literature. We anticipate that reinforcement learning-based automated design tools will accelerate the development of the SiDB quantum dot computing technology, leading to its eventual adoption in specialized computing hardware.},

More profoundly, the 1.58-bit LLM defines a new scaling law and recipe for training new generations of LLMs that are both high-performance and cost-effective.

Fortunately, re- cent advances in Hessian-free optimization have been able to overcome the difficulties associated with training RNNs, making it possible to apply them successfully to challenging sequence prob- lems. In this paper we demonstrate the power of RNNs trained with the new Hessian-Free op- timizer (HF) by applying them to character-level language modeling tasks. The standard RNN ar- chitecture, while effective, is not ideally suited for such tasks, so we introduce a new RNN variant that uses multiplicative (or gated) con- nections which allow the current input charac- ter to determine the transition matrix from one hidden state vector to the next. After training the multiplicative RNN with the HF optimizer for five days on 8 high-end Graphics Processing Units, we were able to surpass the performance of the best previous single method for character- level language modeling a hierarchical non- parametric sequence model. To our knowledge this represents the largest recurrent neural net- work application to date.},

This is a new variant of the previously proposed generators, TGFSR, modified so as to admit a Mersenne-prime period. The characteristic polynomial has many terms. The distribution up to v bits accuracy for 1 {$\leq$} v {$\leq$} 32 is also shown to be good. An algorithm is also given that checks the primitivity of the characteristic polynomial of MT with computational complexity O(p2) where p is the degree of the polynomial.We implemented this generator in portable C-code. It passed several stringent statistical tests, including diehard. Its speed is comparable to other modern generators. Its merits are due to the efficient algorithms that are unique to polynomial calculations over the two-element field.},

We propose to generate a random bit using a position measurement of a single mobile charge on a coupled pair of quantum dots. True randomness of the measurement outcome is provided by quantum mechanics via Born's rule. A random bit string may be generated using a sequence of repeated measurements on the same double quantum dot (DQD) system. Any bias toward a ``0'' measurement or a ``1'' measurement may be removed or tuned as desired simply by adjusting the detuning between localized states. Device tunability provides versatility, enabling this quantum random number generator (QRNG) to support applications in which no bias is desired, or where a tunable bias is desired. We discuss a metal-dot implementation as well as a molecular implementation of this QRNG. Basic quantum mechanical principles are used to study power dissipation and timing considerations for the generation of random bit strings. The DQD offers a small form factor and, in a metallic implementation, is usable in the case where cryogenic operations are desirable (as in the case of quantum computing). For room-temperature applications, a molecular DQD may be used.},

We also show how the device can configure itself progressively, avoiding design calculations and allowing the device to stabilize itself against drifts in component properties and to continually adjust itself to changing conditions. This self-configuration operates by training with the desired pairs of orthogonal input and output functions, using sets of detectors and local feedback loops to set individual optical elements within the device, with no global feedback or multiparameter optimization required. Simple mappings, such as spatial mode conversions and polarization control, can be implemented using standard planar integrated optics. In the spirit of a universal machine, we show that other linear operations, including frequency and time mappings, as well as nonreciprocal operation, are possible in principle, even if very challenging in practice, thus proving there is at least one constructive design for any conceivable linear optical component; such a universal device can also be self-configuring. This approach is general for linear waves, and could be applied to microwaves, acoustics, and quantum mechanical superpositions.},

During training, the model is fully end-to-end differentiable allowing gradient-based training, and at inference time it operates in a fully discrete state space. This enables learning local update rules for cellular automata while preserving their inherent discrete nature. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach through a series of milestones: (1) fully learning the rules of Conway's Game of Life, (2) generating checkerboard patterns that exhibit resilience to noise and damage, (3) growing a lizard shape, and (4) multi-color pattern generation. Our model successfully learns recurrent circuits capable of generating desired target patterns. For simpler patterns, we observe success with both synchronous and asynchronous updates, demonstrating significant generalization capabilities and robustness to perturbations. We make the case that this combination of DLGNs and NCA represents a step toward programmable matter and robust computing systems that combine binary logic, neural network adaptability, and localized processing. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first successful application of differentiable logic gate networks in recurrent architectures.},

We ensure the resulting circuit is functionally correct by adding a patch for the cases in which the model is not 100\% accurate. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we apply the proposed framework to synthesis of new multiplier circuits. The resulting multipliers are significantly smaller than the best known implementations, with up to 32.8\% area reduction. Finally, the generated multipliers were integrated in the core of a state-ofthe-art logic synthesis tool, leading to 1.98\% area and 0.54\% WNS reductions, post place and route, on designs specialized in performing AI tasks.},

However, since the number system is positional, it needs to "unpack>>>> bits, perform computations, and repack the bits back to binary (emphe.g., partial products in multiplication).An alternative representation is the unary number system: we use N bits, out of which the first M are 1 and the rest are 0 to represent the value M/N. We present a novel method which first converts binary numbers to unary using thermometer encoders, then uses a "scaling network>>>> followed by voting gates that we call "alternator logic>>>>, followed by an adder tree to convert the numbers back to the binary format. For monotonically increasing functions, the scaling network is all we need, which essentially uses only the routing resources and flip-flops on the FPGA architecture. Our method is especially well-suited to FPGAs due to the abundant availability of routing and FF resources, and for the ability of FPGAs to realize high fanout gates for highly oscillating functions. We compare our method to stochastic computing and to conventional binary implementations on a number of functions, as well as on two common image processing applications. Our method is clearly superior to the conventional binary implementation: our area\texttimes delay cost is on average only 3\%, 8\% and 32\% of the binary method for 8-, 10-, and 12-bit resolutions respectively. Compared to stochastic computing, our cost is 6\%, 5\%, and 8\% for those resolutions. The area cost includes conversions from and to the binary format. Our method out performs the conventional binary method on an edge detection algorithm. However, it is not competitive with the binary method on the median filtering application due to the high cost of generating and saving unary representations of the input pixels.},

  abstract = {The ability for dangling bonds (DBs) to encode bit-information and perform logic computation has been demonstrated in recent works. This was made possible by the ability to fabricate DBs with atomic precision as well as to observe and control their charge states. An observed tendency for charge reconfiguration to occur among an array of DBs as the system relaxes to the ground state was utilized to create logic wires and gates. Building on these novel advances, this thesis explores a breadth of topics surrounding the DB computation platform. A computer-aided design tool, SiQAD, was developed as part of a greater research effort to enable the rapid design and simulation of DB layouts. Among the simulation tools included in SiQAD, this work most extensively contributed to the development of multiple ground state charge configuration finders, enabling the exploration of prospective DB logic gate and circuit designs. Similarities have been drawn between DB circuit scaling properties with those of existing field-coupled nanocomputing (FCN) research, justifying the use of FCN architectures as blueprints for DB logic research. As such, this thesis proposes and analyzes DB logic implementations from the gate level to the application level. This work identifies hardware acceleration of machine learning inference as a novel prospective application on the DB computational platform. Matrix multiplication is a common operation in the inference stage of many neural network implementations, and presents a bottleneck to inference performance. Recent works have proposed, or even made commercially available, various hardware inference acceleration frameworks. Among them, the matrix multiply unit (MXU) found in Google's Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) has been indentified to be architecturally favorable for implementation on the DB platform. This work proposes a DB adaptation of the MXU with logic layouts and clocking configurations optimized for the platform. Comparing the DB MXU to Google's MXU, this work estimates an improvement of 1 order of magnitude in area efficiency and up to 7 orders of magnitude in power efficiency when pegged to the same clock rate.},

However, current simulation capabilities offered by SiQAD do not include defect simulations, meaning that nearsurface imperfections are not taken into account when designing these large SiDB layouts. This work introduces fixed-charge simulation into SimAnneal, the main SiDB charge configuration simulator of SiQAD, to cover an important class of defects that has a non-negligible effect on the behavior of nearby SiDB charge states at non-negligible distances---up to 10 nm and beyond. We compared the simulation results with past experimental fittings and found the results to match fairly accurately. For the three types of defects tested, T1 arsenic, T2 silicon vacancy, and a stray SiDB, the root mean square percentage errors between experimental and simulated results are 3\%, 17\%, and 4\% respectively. The availability of this new simulation capability will provide researchers with more tools to recreate experimental environments and perform sensitivity analyses on logic designs.},

Silicon dangling bond (SiDB) logic emerges as a promising avenue in this quest, leveraging the quantum-dot-like properties of SiDBs and atomically precise fabrication techniques to realize logic functions at the nanometer scale. Advances in computeraided design (CAD) tools specialized for SiDB logic exploration have also opened the door to novel logic research from the gate- to application-level. This paper introduces a lattice vector formulation for SiDB logic designs on alternative silicon lattice orientations, enabling the exploration of logic gates on arbitrary lattice orientations and addressing the limitations of previous SiDB logic research confined to the H-Si(100)-2\texttimes 1 surface. A comprehensive workflow for designing standard tile libraries compatible with design automation frameworks is proposed, facilitating the scaling of SiDB layouts to large-scale systems implementation on multiple lattice orientations. We demonstrate the proposed lattice vector representation and the library design workflow through a case study on the H-Si(111)-1\texttimes 1 surface, showcasing the first logic gates designed for this orientation. This advancement opens new avenues for SiDB logic research, enabling rigorous evaluations of various lattice orientations for future logic design studies and experimental investigations.},

Building on prior works using Menger and Zadeh T-norms, we investigate the \L ukasiewicz T-norm as an alternative relaxation for classical logic gates. While it provides strong gradients in some regions, its flat areas result in vanishing gradients that hinder training. To address this issue, we use an initialization strategy that is analogous to residual connection in Neural Networks to encourage error signal propagation during training. Our empirical results show that \L ukasiewicz based DLNs, though slightly less accurate, benefit from faster inference and lower memory requirements compared to Neural Networks, giving the opportunity of practical application in, e.g., resource constrained devices. Due to the structural clarity, DLNs facilitate direct inspection and tracing of information flow, which makes them suitable for application in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI).},

This paper describes the way in which they differ from other optical media, and clarifies what they can do. In particular, three important issues are considered: light confinement, frequency dispersion and spatial dispersion. First, I describe the latest status and impact of ultra-strong light confinement in a wavelength-cubic volume achieved in photonic crystals. Second, the extreme reduction in the speed of light is reported, which was achieved as a result of frequency dispersion management. Third, strange negative refraction in photonic crystals is introduced, which results from their unique spatial dispersion, and it is clarified how this leads to perfect imaging. The last two sections are devoted to applications of these novel properties. First, I report the fact that strong light confinement and huge light--matter interaction enhancement make strongly modulated photonic crystals promising for on-chip all-optical processing, and present several examples including all-optical switches/memories and optical logics. As a second application, it is shown that the strong light confinement and slow light in strongly modulated photonic crystals enable the adiabatic tuning of light, which leads to various novel ways of controlling light, such as adiabatic frequency conversion, efficient optomechanics systems, photon memories and photons pinning.},

This tool, referred to as HDLQ, allows a designer to verify the logic characteristics of a QCA system, while supporting within a design environment different operational mechanisms (such as fault injection) and the unique features of QCA (such as bidirectionality and timing/clocking partitioning). The applicability of this design environment to various memory circuits for logic and timing verification is presented in detail. Various defective conditions for kinks due to thermodynamic effects and permanent faults due to manufacturing defects are considered for injection.},

Can these correlations be inferred from small problems with known ground states to accelerate the search for the ground states of larger problems? Here, we demonstrate the strategy on Ising spin glasses, where the interaction matrices are drawn from protein contact maps. We use graph neural network to learn the mapping from an interaction matrix \$J\$ to a ground state configuration, yielding guesses for the set of most probable configurations. Given these guesses, we show that ground state configurations can be searched much faster than in vanilla simulated annealing. For large problems, a model trained on small \$J\$ matrices predicts a configurations whose energy is much lower than those obtained by simulated annealing, indicating the size generalizability of the strategy.},

In this work, we explore logic gate networks for machine learning tasks by learning combinations of logic gates. These networks comprise logic gates such as ``AND'' and ``XOR'', which allow for very fast execution. The difficulty in learning logic gate networks is that they are conventionally non-differentiable and therefore do not allow training with gradient descent. Thus, to allow for effective training, we propose differentiable logic gate networks, an architecture that combines real-valued logics and a continuously parameterized relaxation of the network. The resulting discretized logic gate networks achieve fast inference speeds, e.g., beyond a million images of MNIST per second on a single CPU core.},

Mesh representations support powerful numerical integration methods and their resolution can be adapted to strike favorable trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. However, highdimensional scientific simulations are very expensive to run, and solvers and parameters must often be tuned individually to each system studied. Here we introduce MESHGRAPHNETS, a framework for learning mesh-based simulations using graph neural networks. Our model can be trained to pass messages on a mesh graph and to adapt the mesh discretization during forward simulation. Our results show it can accurately predict the dynamics of a wide range of physical systems, including aerodynamics, structural mechanics, and cloth. The model's adaptivity supports learning resolution-independent dynamics and can scale to more complex state spaces at test time. Our method is also highly efficient, running 1-2 orders of magnitude faster than the simulation on which it is trained. Our approach broadens the range of problems on which neural network simulators can operate and promises to improve the efficiency of complex, scientific modeling tasks.},

A characteristic negative differential resistance (NDR) feature is evident in the scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurements of DBs on both n- and p-type doped samples. We find that a common model accounts for both observations. Atomspecific Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) measurements confirm the energetic position of the DB's charge transition levels, corroborating STS studies. We show that under different tip-induced fields the DB can be supplied with electrons from two distinct reservoirs: the bulk conduction band and/or the valence band. We measure the filling and emptying rates of the DBs in the energy regime where electrons are supplied by the bulk valence band. We show that adding point charges in the vicinity of a DB shifts observed STS and NDR features due to Coulombic interactions.},

However, one of the most critical challenges in implementing circuits in ASDB nanotechnology is output stability and possible defects, such as DB omission, DB misalignment, and DB extra deposition, which can be overcome using a suitable designing pattern. Therefore, developing stable and robust structures is considered as one of essential topics in ASDB. This paper first proposes two novel and stable computing circuits, including a three-input majority voter (MV3) and three-input XOR (XOR3); based on triangular and rhombus patterns, respectively. Then, an efficient ASDB full-adder is designed using the suggested MV3 and XOR3 gates. Finally, two and four-bit ripple carry adders are developed using proposed full-adder. Simulation results indicate that the suggested MV3 and XOR3 are superior to previous designs, by more than 80\%, 48\%, and 9.5\%, averagely; in terms of occupied area, energy, and occurrence, respectively. Moreover, the proposed gates are investigated against possible defects, and the results show high stability.},

This article introduces a novel nanotechnology that uses atomic-scale silicon dangling bonds (ASDB) to create high-performance, low-power, nanoscale logic circuits. DBs are atoms that can form basic logic gates on a silicon surface using a scanning tunneling microscope device. ASDB can also be an alternative to the existing complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology. The article also proposes a new bar-shaped pattern to design gates and logic circuits with ASDB nano tecnolgoy. The bar-shaped pattern improves the reliability of the output, reduces the area and power consumption, and solves the problem of interatomic energy effects of ASDB. The article demonstrates the efficiency of the bar-shaped pattern by implementing two-input gates such as AND, NAND, OR, NOR, XOR, XNOR, and a 2:1 multiplexer with ASDB. The article also uses a powerful tool called SiQAD to simulate and verify the performance of the proposed structures with ASDB. According to the simulation results, the proposed logic gates are more energy efficient, stable, and compact than the previous structures. They consume 35\% and 24.34\% less energy and have 14.18\% more stability, respectively.},

  title = {Energy Spectra Informed Performance of Clocked Quantum-Dot Cellular Automata},
  author = {Retallick, Jacob},
  year = 2020,
  abstract = {Understanding the dynamic behaviour of nanoscale quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) networks involves the simulation of large numbers of QCA devices, with the complexity of the full quantum treatment exponential in the network size. Previous attempts to limit this complexity introduce simplifying assumptions with known inaccuracies. In this thesis we investigate an alternate approach, extracting performance metrics through analysing the low energy eigenspectrum of a clocked network. We make two major contributions. In the first part of this thesis, we study the use of silicon dangling bonds (SiDBs) as a platform for combinatorial logic, and ultimately nanoscale QCA. We present models for understanding the preferred configurations and dynamics of charges in these structures. We consider the clocking of SiDB-based QCA wires, and reveal a complicated trajectory of charge states that serve as a challenge for QCA operation. By studying SiDB-based QCA from the framework of the familiar 3-state model, in which these preferred charge states translate to eigenstates of a system Hamiltonian, we determine conditions for which SiDB-QCA wires can cor- rectly operate when clocked. These conditions are potentially impractical unless net-neutral SiDB arrangements can be achieved. The remaining bulk of the thesis revolves around the link between QCA clocking and quantum annealing. We first investigate the adiabaticity of simple 2-state QCA networks under zone clocking. We present upper bounds on the clocking frequency beyond which adiabaticity falls below a 99\% threshold, and demonstrate how we can efficiently estimate clocking performance using only a few of the energy eigenstates. Due to a natural mapping between QCA cells and superconduct- ing flux qubits, the potential for investigating performance using a physical quantum annealer is explored. Methods for embedding QCA networks onto the annealer are discussed and a selection of annealing results are analyzed. Finally, we establish a method for decomposing the system Hamiltonian into contributions from given components, and a means to identify meaningful components which critically affect clocking performance. This framework reveals a heuristic algorithm for approximating the low energy eigenspectra of large QCA networks, enabling future investigations into the performance of networks well beyond previous size limitations.},

The pneumatic logic circuits perform various combinational and sequential logic calculations with binary pneumatic signals (atmosphere and vacuum), producing cascadable outputs based on Boolean operations. A complex microprocessor is constructed from combinations of various logic circuits and receives pneumatically encoded serial commands at a single input line. The device then decodes the temporal command sequence by spatial parallelization, computes necessary logic calculations between parallelized command bits, stores command information for signal transportation and maintenance, and finally executes the command for the target devices. Thus, such pneumatic microprocessors will function as a universal on-chip control platform to perform complex parallel operations for large-scale integrated microfluidic devices. To demonstrate the working principles, we have built 2-bit, 3-bit, 4-bit, and 8-bit microprocessors to control various target devices for applications such as four color dye mixing, and multiplexed channel fluidic control. By significantly reducing the need for external controllers, the digital pneumatic microprocessor can be used as a universal on-chip platform to autonomously manipulate microfluids in a high throughput manner.},

But vanishing gradients, discretization errors, and high training cost impede scaling these networks. Even with dedicated parameter initialization schemes from subsequent works, increasing depth still harms accuracy. We show that the root cause of these issues lies in the underlying parametrization of logic gate neurons themselves. To overcome this issue, we propose a reparametrization that also shrinks the parameter size logarithmically in the number of inputs per gate. For binary inputs, this already reduces the model size by 4x, speeds up the backward pass by up to 1.86x, and converges in 8.5x fewer training steps. On top of that, we show that the accuracy on CIFAR-100 remains stable and sometimes superior to the original parametrization.},

Reactivity is observed to be dependent on the polarity between tip and surface while the area over which reactivity modulation is established scales according to the dopant concentration in the sample. We account for these observations with examination of the competition kinetics applicable to the CBMK/H-Si reaction and determine how said kinetics are affected by the charge state of DB sites associated with reaction initiation and propagation. Our experiments demonstrate a new paradigm in lithographic control of a self-assembly process on H-Si and reveal a variant to the well-known radical mediated chain reaction chemistry applicable to the H-Si surface where self-assembly is initiated with dative bond formation between the molecule and a DB site.},

Recently, simulation of Bose--Hubbard Hamiltonians using cold atoms revealed previously hidden local correlations. However, fermionic many-body Hubbard phenomena such as unconventional superconductivity and spin liquids are more difficult to simulate using cold atoms. To date the required single-site measurements and cooling remain problematic, while only ensemble measurements have been achieved. Here we simulate a two-site Hubbard Hamiltonian at low effective temperatures with single-site resolution using subsurface dopants in silicon. We measure quasi-particle tunnelling maps of spin-resolved states with atomic resolution, finding interference processes from which the entanglement entropy and Hubbard interactions are quantified. Entanglement, determined by spin and orbital degrees of freedom, increases with increasing valence bond length. We find separation-tunable Hubbard interaction strengths that are suitable for simulating strongly correlated phenomena in larger arrays of dopants, establishing dopants as a platform for quantum simulation of the Hubbard model.},

As the number of applicants might vary between only one patient to manufacturing tissue for high-throughput drug screening, designing a process will necessitate a high degree of flexibility, robustness, as well as comprehensive monitoring. To enable quality by design process optimisation for future application, establishing systematic data storage routines suitable for automated analytical tools is highly desirable as a first step. This manuscript introduces a workflow for process design, documentation within an electronic lab notebook and monitoring to supervise the product quality over time or at different locations. Lab notes, analytical data and corresponding metadata are stored in a systematic hierarchy within the research data infrastructure Kadi4Mat, which allows for continuous, flexible data structuring and access management. To support the experimental and analytical workflow, additional features were implemented to enhance and build upon the functionality provided by Kadi4Mat, including browser-based file previews and a Python tool for the combined filtering and extraction of data. The structured research data management with Kadi4Mat enables retrospective data grouping and usage by process analytical technology tools connecting individual analysis software to machine-readable data exchange formats.},

Crosstalk side-channel attacks are a real threat in large designs assembled from various IPs, where some IPs are provided by trusted and some by untrusted sources. It suffices that a ring-oscillator based sensor is conveniently routed next to a signal that carries secret information (for instance, a cryptographic key), for this information to possibly get leaked. To address this security concern, we apply several different strategies and evaluate them on benchmark circuits from Verilog-to-Routing tool suite. Our experiments show that, for a quite conservative scenario where 10-20\% of all design nets are carrying sensitive information, the crosstalk-attack-aware router ensures that no information leaks at a very small penalty: 1.58-7.69\% increase in minimum routing channel width and 0.12-1.18\% increase in critical path delay, on average. In comparison, in an AES-128 cryptographic core, less than 5\% of nets carry the key or the intermediate state values of interest to an attacker, making it highly likely that the overhead for obtaining a secure design is, in practice, even smaller.},

Regenerative medicine has been developed to make natural organs or tissue-like structures with biocompatible materials and solve the donor shortage problem. Using biomaterials and embedded cells, a bioprinter enables the fabrication of complex and functional three-dimensional (3D) structures of the organs or tissues for regenerative medicine. Moreover, conventional surgical 3D models are made of rigid plastic or rubbers, preventing surgeons from interacting with real organ or tissue-like models. Thus, finding suitable biomaterials and printing methods will accelerate the printing of sophisticated organ structures and the development of realistic models to refine surgical techniques and tools before the surgery. In addition, printing parameters (e.g., printing speed, dispensing pressure, and nozzle diameter) considered in the bioprinting process should be optimized. Therefore, machine learning (ML) technology can be a powerful tool to optimize the numerous bioprinting parameters. Overall, this review paper is focused on various ideas on the ML applications of 3D printing and bioprinting to optimize parameters and procedures.},

This work explores the variations in circuit quality, i.e. noise, that arise when CAD algorithms are altered to choose randomly when faced with such equal-cost alternatives. Noise sources are identified in logic synthesis and technology mapping algorithms, and experimental results are presented which show standard deviations of 3.3\% and 3.7\% from the mean in post-routed delay and power. As a means of dealing with this variation, early timing and power prediction metrics can be applied after technology mapping to find the best circuits in the presence of noise. When applied to designs with over 1.5\% variation in delay and power, the best prediction models have a 40\% probability of capturing the best circuit when predicting the top 10\% of circuits in a group of noise-injected circuits.},

  abstract = {Quantum-dot Cellular Automata~(QCA) is an emerging nanotechnology with remarkable performance and energy efficiency. Computation and information transfer in QCA are based on field forces rather than electric currents. As a consequence, new strategies are required for design automation approaches in order to cope with the arising challenges. One of these challenges is the transport of information, which is affected by two particularities of the QCA technology. First, information flow in QCA is controlled by external clocks, and second, QCA is a planar technology in which gates, as well as interconnections, are mostly located in the same layer. The former demands proper synchronization already during the circuit design phase, while the latter results in high area costs for interconnections. This work focuses on both constraints and discusses its impact on the implementation of QCA circuits. Further, the concept of local and global synchronicity in QCA circuits is explored. The obtained results indicate that relaxing the global synchronicity constraint can reduce design size by about 70\% while the throughput performance declines by similar values. Additionally, it can be shown that the impact of interconnections in QCA, like wires, fan-outs, and crossovers, is indeed substantial. That means, up to 75\% of the total area is occupied by interconnections.},

Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses `value networks' to evaluate board positions and `policy networks' to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8\% winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.},

However, there is a confusing plethora of different neural network methods that are used in the literature and in industry. This paper describes a set of concrete best practices that document analysis researchers can use to get good results with neural networks. The most important practice is that convolutional neural networks are better suited for visual document tasks than fully connected networks. We propose that a simple "do-it-yourself" implementation of convolution neural networks does not require complex methods, such as momentum, weight decay, structure-dependent learning rates, averaging layers, tangent prop, or even finely-tuning the architecture. The end result is a very simple yet general architecture which can yield state-of-the-art performance for document analysis. We illustrate our claims on the MNIST set of English digit images.},

  abstract = {With recent advances in Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) architecture and design, the robustness and scalability of design implementation tools is becoming increasingly important. In an FPGA implementation flow, the basic logic elements (BLEs) like flip-flops (FFs) and lookup tables (LUTs) are clustered into adaptive logic modules (ALMs) and Logic Array Blocks (LABs). Clustering is a key stage in the flow that determines whether a design can fit onto the target FPGA device, and whether the Quality of Results (QoR) goals are met. Traditionally, FPGA implementation tools have used greedy clustering techniques. This paper presents an innovative clustering algorithm based on a new concept of consensus building at a large scale (LSC). The LSC algorithm is designed to work with designs with millions of elements, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first parallel clustering algorithm in the industry. In our industrial designs benchmark set using modern FPGA devices on two deep submicron technology nodes, the new clustering engine results in average improvements of 0.5\% and 2.5\% in maximum clock frequency (Fmax) for the two target devices. Additionally, wiring usage is improved on the average by 2.8\% and 6.5\% respectively. The fitting success rate of highly utilized designs is also improved significantly with the new clustering engine.},

  abstract = {Deep learning has led to unprecedented successes in solving some very difficult problems in domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, and general pattern recognition. These achievements are the culmination of decades-long research into better training techniques and deeper neural network models, as well as improvements in hardware platforms that are used to train and execute the deep neural network models. Many application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) hardware accelerators for deep learning have garnered interest in recent years due to their improved performance and energy-efficiency over conventional CPU and GPU architectures. However, these accelerators are constrained by fundamental bottlenecks due to (1) the slowdown in CMOS scaling, which has limited computational and performance-per-watt capabilities of emerging electronic processors; and (2) the use of metallic interconnects for data movement, which do not scale well and are a major cause of bandwidth, latency, and energy inefficiencies in almost every contemporary processor. Silicon photonics has emerged as a promising CMOS-compatible alternative to realize a new generation of deep learning accelerators that can use light for both communication and computation. This article surveys the landscape of silicon photonics to accelerate deep learning, with a coverage of developments across design abstractions in a bottom-up manner, to convey both the capabilities and limitations of the silicon photonics paradigm in the context of deep learning acceleration.},

  abstract = {We introduce meta-prompting, an effective scaffolding technique designed to enhance the functionality of language models (LMs). This approach transforms a single LM into a multi-faceted conductor, adept at managing and integrating multiple independent LM queries. By employing high-level instructions, meta-prompting guides the LM to break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable subtasks. These subtasks are then handled by distinct "expert" instances of the same LM, each operating under specific, tailored instructions. Central to this process is the LM itself, in its role as the conductor, which ensures seamless communication and effective integration of the outputs from these expert models. It additionally employs its inherent critical thinking and robust verification processes to refine and authenticate the end result. This collaborative prompting approach empowers a single LM to simultaneously act as a comprehensive orchestrator and a panel of diverse experts, significantly enhancing its performance across a wide array of tasks. The zero-shot, task-agnostic nature of meta-prompting greatly simplifies user interaction by obviating the need for detailed, task-specific instructions. Furthermore, our research demonstrates the seamless integration of external tools, such as a Python interpreter, into the meta-prompting framework, thereby broadening its applicability and utility. Through rigorous experimentation with GPT-4, we establish the superiority of meta-prompting over conventional scaffolding methods: When averaged across all tasks, including the Game of 24, Checkmate-in-One, and Python Programming Puzzles, meta-prompting, augmented with a Python interpreter functionality, surpasses standard prompting by 17.1\%, expert (dynamic) prompting by 17.3\%, and multipersona prompting by 15.2\%.},

We have observed that a nanocatalyst, that is, a droplet of melted gold--silicon alloy of about 5 nm in diameter, is actually formed in a pit on a H-terminated surface in the narrow temperature range around 500{$\mkern1mu^\circ$}C. We have concluded that, in this specific temperature range, nanocatalysts can be melted, remain mutually isolated, absorb silicon effectively, and expel Si nanowires. Based on the result, we have proposed a method of making a thin template, which facilitates to decide the nucleation sites and the sizes of nanocatalysts, resulting in the precise control of those of Si nanowires.},

To alleviate that, we propose LUT-NN, the first system to empower inference by table lookup, to reduce inference cost. LUT-NN learns the typical features for each operator, named centroid, and precompute the results for these centroids to save in lookup tables. During inference, the results of the closest centroids with the inputs can be read directly from the table, as the approximated outputs without computations.LUT-NN integrates two major novel techniques: (1) differentiable centroid learning through backpropagation, which adapts three levels of approximation to minimize the accuracy impact by centroids; (2) table lookup inference execution, which comprehensively considers different levels of parallelism, memory access reduction, and dedicated hardware units for optimal performance. LUT-NN is evaluated on multiple real tasks, covering image and speech recognition, and nature language processing. Compared to related work, LUT-NN improves accuracy by 66\% to 92\%, achieving similar level with the original models. LUT-NN reduces the cost at all dimensions, including FLOPs ({$\leq$} 16\texttimes ), model size ({$\leq$} 7\texttimes ), latency ({$\leq$} 6.8\texttimes ), memory ({$\leq$} 6.5\texttimes ), and power ({$\leq$} 41.7\%).},

This shows that generalized coherent states tend to be produced naturally. A sufficient condition for this to happen is shown to be that the spectral function is analytic and nonlinear. For a chain of coupled oscillators, the nonlinearity requirement means that waves must be dispersive, so that localized wave packets become suppressed. Virtually all harmonic heat-bath models in the literature satisfy this constraint, and we have good reason to believe that coherent states and their generalizations are not merely a useful analytical tool, but that nature is indeed full of them. Standard proofs of the CLT rely heavily on the fact that probability densities are non-negative. Although the CLT is generally not applicable if the densities are allowed to take negative values, we show that a CLT does indeed hold for a special class of such functions. We find that, intriguingly, nature has arranged things so that all Wigner functions belong to this class.},

This allows to overcome physical boundaries of conventional solutions such as CMOS and, hence, constitutes a promising direction for future computing devices. Despite these promises, however, the development of (automatic) design methods for QCAs is still in its infancy. In fact, QCA circuits are mainly designed manually thus far and only few heuristics are available. This frequently leads to unsatisfactory results and generally makes it hard to evaluate the quality of respective QCA designs. In this work, we propose an exact solution for the design of QCA circuits that can be configured e. g. to generate circuits that satisfy certain design objectives and/or physical constraints. For the first time, this allows for design exploration of QCA circuits. Experimental evaluations and case studies demonstrate the benefit of the proposed solution.},

The design problem basically boils down to the question of how to place basic operations and route their connections so that the desired function results while, at the same time, further constraints (related to timing, clocking, path lengths, etc.) are satisfied. While several solutions for this problem have been proposed, interestingly no clear understanding about the complexity of the underlying task exists thus far. In this research note, we consider this problem and eventually prove that placement and routing for tile-based FCN circuits is NP-complete.

Promising candidates can be found in the class of Field-coupled Nanocomputing (FCN) devices as they allow for highest processing performance with tremendously low energy dissipation. With upcoming design automation in this domain, the need for formal verification approaches arises. Unfortunately, FCN circuits come with certain domain-specific properties that render conventional methods for the verification non-applicable. In this paper, we investigate this issue and propose a verification approach for FCN circuits that addresses this problem. For the first time, this provides researchers and engineers with an automatic method that allows them to check whether an obtained FCN circuit design indeed implements the given/desired function. A prototype implementation demonstrates the applicability of the proposed approach.},

Despite their promises, the design of corresponding FCN circuits is still in its infancy. In fact, state-of-the-art solutions still heavily rely on conventional synthesis approaches that do not take the tight physical constraints of FCN circuits (particularly with respect to routability and clocking) into account. Instead, physical design is conducted in a second step in which a classical logic network is mapped onto an FCN layout. Using this two-stage approach with a classical and FCN-oblivious logic network as an intermediate result, frequently leads to substantial quality loss or completely impractical results. In this work, we propose a one-pass synthesis scheme for FCN circuits, which conducts both steps, synthesis and physical design, in a single run. For the first time, this allows to generate exact, i. e., minimal FCN circuits for a given functionality.},

Additionally, a prototypical automatic placement and routing algorithm is presented, utilizing STM data from physical experiments to obtain dotaccurate circuitry resilient to atomic surface defects. Initial evaluations on surfaces with varying defect rates demonstrate their critical impact, suggesting that fabrication processes must achieve defect rates of around 0.1 \% to further advance this circuit technology.},

  author = {Wang, Zhihai and others},
  abstract = {Logic Synthesis (LS) aims to generate an optimized logic circuit satisfying a given functionality, which generally consists of circuit translation and optimization. It is a challenging and fundamental combinatorial optimization problem in integrated circuit design. Traditional LS approaches rely on manually designed heuristics to tackle the LS task, while machine learning recently offers a promising approach towards next-generation logic synthesis by neural circuit generation and optimization. In this paper, we first revisit the application of differentiable neural architecture search (DNAS) methods to circuit generation and found from extensive experiments that existing DNAS methods struggle to exactly generate circuits, scale poorly to large circuits, and exhibit high sensitivity to hyper-parameters. Then we provide three major insights for these challenges from extensive empirical analysis: 1) DNAS tends to overfit to too many skip-connections, consequently wasting a significant portion of the network's expressive capabilities; 2) DNAS suffers from the structure bias between the network architecture and the circuit inherent structure, leading to inefficient search; 3) the learning difficulty of different input-output examples varies significantly, leading to severely imbalanced learning. To address these challenges in a systematic way, we propose a novel regularized triangle-shaped circuit network generation framework, which leverages our key insights for completely accurate and scalable circuit generation. Furthermore, we propose an evolutionary algorithm assisted by reinforcement learning agent restarting technique for efficient and effective neural circuit optimization. Extensive experiments on four different circuit benchmarks demonstrate that our method can precisely generate circuits with up to 1200 nodes. Moreover, our synthesized circuits significantly outperform the state-of-the-art results from several competitive winners in IWLS 2022 and 2023 competitions.},

  abstract = {State-of-the-art results in large language models (LLMs) often rely on scale, which becomes computationally expensive. This has sparked a research agenda to reduce these models' parameter counts and computational costs without significantly impacting their performance. Our study focuses on transformer-based LLMs, specifically targeting the computationally intensive feedforward networks (FFNs), which are less studied than attention blocks. We consider three structured linear parameterizations of the FFN using efficient low-rank and block-diagonal matrices. In contrast to many previous works that examined these approximations, our study i) explores these structures from a training-from-scratch perspective, ii) scales up to 1.3B parameters, and iii) is conducted within recent Transformer-based LLMs rather than convolutional architectures. We demonstrate that these structures can lead to actual computational gains in various scenarios, including online decoding when using a pre-merge technique. Additionally, we propose a novel training regime, called self-guided training, aimed at improving the poor training dynamics that these approximations exhibit when used from initialization. Interestingly, the scaling performance of structured matrices is explored, revealing steeper curves in scaling training FLOPs, along with a favorable scaling trend in the overtraining regime. Specifically, we show that wide and structured networks can utilize training FLOPs more efficiently, with fewer parameters and lower loss than dense models at their optimal trade-off.

Such complex structures can be used as systems with custom optical properties, circuit elements for quantum-dot cellular automata, and quantum computing. Considerations on macro-to-atom connections are discussed.},

  abstract = {Model quantification uses low bit-width values to represent the weight matrices of models, which is a promising approach to reduce both storage and computational overheads of deploying highly anticipated LLMs. However, existing quantization methods suffer severe performance degradation when the bit-width is extremely reduced, and thus focus on utilizing 4-bit or 8-bit values to quantize models. This paper boldly quantizes the weight matrices of LLMs to 1-bit, paving the way for the extremely low bit-width deployment of LLMs. For this target, we introduce a 1-bit quantization-aware training (QAT) framework named OneBit, including a novel 1-bit parameter representation method to better quantize LLMs as well as an effective parameter initialization method based on matrix decomposition to improve the convergence speed of the QAT framework. Sufficient experimental results indicate that OneBit achieves good performance (at least 83\% of the non-quantized performance) with robust training processes when only using 1-bit weight matrices.},

  abstract = {Modern neural networks exhibit state-of-the-art performance on many existing benchmarks, but their high computational requirements and energy usage cause researchers to explore more efficient solutions for real-world deployment. Differentiable logic gate networks (DLGNs) learns a large network of logic gates for efficient image classification. However, learning a network that can solve simple problems like CIFAR-10 or CIFAR-100 can take days to weeks to train. Even then, almost half of the neurons remains unused, causing a discretization gap. This discretization gap hinders real-world deployment of DLGNs, as the performance drop between training and inference negatively impacts accuracy. We inject Gumbel noise with a straight-through estimator during training to significantly speed up training, improve neuron utilization, and decrease the discretization gap. We theoretically show that this results from implicit Hessian regularization, which improves the convergence properties of DLGNs. We train networks 4.5\texttimes{} faster in wall-clock time, reduce the discretization gap by 98\%, and reduce the number of unused gates by 100\%.},

In other domains such as learning from non-structural data like texts and images, reasoning on extracted structures (like the dependency trees of sentences and the scene graphs of images) is an important research topic which also needs graph reasoning models. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are neural models that capture the dependence of graphs via message passing between the nodes of graphs. In recent years, variants of GNNs such as graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention network (GAT), graph recurrent network (GRN) have demonstrated ground-breaking performances on many deep learning tasks. In this survey, we propose a general design pipeline for GNN models and discuss the variants of each component, systematically categorize the applications, and propose four open problems for future research.},

These personalized wearables could be fabricated via ex situ printing, which involves first printing a design on a planar substrate and then deploying it to the target surface. However, this can result in a geometrically and dynamically mismatched interface between printed materials and target surfaces. In situ printing provides a potential remedy by directly printing 3D constructs on the target surfaces. This new manufacturing procedure requires the assistance of artificial intelligence (AI) to sense, adapt and predict the state of the printing environment, such as a dynamically morphing organ. In this Review, we discuss electronic and biological inks for in situ 3D printing, AI-empowered 3D-printing approaches with open-loop, closed-loop and predictive control, and recent developments in surgical robotics and AI that could be integrated in future 3D-printing approaches. We anticipate that this convergence of AI, 3D printing, functional materials and personalized biomedical devices will lead to a compelling future for smart manufacturing.},

Deformable DETR can achieve better performance than DETR (especially on small objects) with 10\texttimes{} less training epochs. Extensive experiments on the COCO benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Code is released at https:// github.com/fundamentalvision/Deformable-DETR.},
