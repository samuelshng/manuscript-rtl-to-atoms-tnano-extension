  abstract = {ABC is a public-domain system for logic synthesis and formal verification of binary logic circuits appearing in synchronous hardware designs ABC combines scalable logic transformations based on And-Inverter Graphs (AIGs), with a variety of innovative algorithms A focus on the synergy of sequential synthesis and sequential verification leads to improvements in both domains This paper introduces ABC, motivates its development, and illustrates its use in formal verification.},
